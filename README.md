SG MotoParker [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b92f8145-72e2-449d-8dea-4d2bcb86b988/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/motoparker/deploys)
===============

Parking in Singapore can be expensive. But it can also be cheaper, or even free. And sometimes it can also be additionally expensive when you get a parking summons for illegal parking. As a motorcyclist myself, I don't always know which carparks can be parked at and sometimes there are locations where LTA or Traffic Police offers don't issue summons. 

This app serves to solve the following for my fellow motorcyclists:

- Locate the nearest parking location for motorcycles
- Filter parking locations based on parking charges
- Share parking locations with other motorcyclists
- Update parking locations when they no longer exist or 

Currently some information is shared via old forum posts or websites from several years ago. By creating a web app, I hope this information can be easily updated and therefore always relevant.

## FAQ

#### Why is this app restricted to Singapore?

Singapore is unique compared to other countries. In other countries, motorcycles which are parked outside of designated parking locations and are not obstructing anything or anyone can be summoned fines ranging from $25 to a few hundred dollars. Where there are designated parking locations, charges can range from $1.20 per day, $1.28 per entry or as high as $6 per entry (6 Battery Road). 

And sometimes, there are areas in Singapore that parking officers overlook and are lenient on unobstructive parking. These locations are not publicly known and are sometimes discovered accidentally. We seek to help more motorcyclists discover these hidden gems with Motor Parker.

Therefore while it _may_ be useful for other countries, it is most useful for Singapore.

#### Why can't we just use the current existing list of locations on other websites?

Personally, when I found myself in situations where I needed to find locations near me to park my motorcycle, going through a list was not a very smart, quick or accurate approach. Further, I found that these lists were not regularly updated and as a regular visitor it was hard for me to update any information if they were outdated.
